# flatpak-builder-runner package

A basic start to creating a working environment for easily creating, building and testing flatpak manifests.

Basic workflow is:

* first run
  * modify preferences for package
  * Add repository (from package menu)


* subsequent runs (as necessary -- works from file and editor context):
  * build
  * install
  * run
  * uninstall


***THIS IS PRE-PRE-ALPHA -- BUYER BEWARE***
