# flatpak-builder-runner package

Credit:

This project uses code from other node modules directly:
* [run-command](https://github.com/kylewlacy/run-command)
* [atom-script](https://github.com/rgbkrk/atom-script)

flatpak-builder-runner is a package for creating a workflow using Atom for packaging, building, running and testing Flatpak apps.

Basic workflow is:

* first run
  * modify preferences for package
  * Add repository (from package menu)


* subsequent runs (as necessary -- works from file and editor context):
  * build
  * install
  * run
  * uninstall


***THIS IS PRE-PRE-ALPHA -- BUYER BEWARE***
